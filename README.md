# Containers
This implementation of C++ STL containers is a result of teamwork. I implemented `vector`, `list`, `map`, `set` and `multiset`.

### Notes
- `BinaryTree` class for map, set and multiset represents Unbalanced Binary Search Tree
- `list` class represents double-linked list of nodes
- Some tests provided for libraries in `tests` directory
- Tests can be run from `src` directory using command `make test` in terminal
- Coverage Report can be generated from `src` directory using command `make report`
- Web-page `index.html` with coverage report can be accessed in `src/report` directory after generation
- To remove artifacts use command `make clean`
